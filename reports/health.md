# Health Report

(Waiting for first automated update)

This file will be automatically updated every 10 minutes with current repository metrics including:
- Stars, forks, and watchers
- Open issues and pull requests  
- Last commit timestamp
- Calculated health score

The automation script will only commit when there are actual changes to these metrics.
